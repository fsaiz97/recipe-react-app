# Instructions  

Create a React app focused on recipes. This app should present users with a list of recipes and allow them to 'like' a recipe.

This task is focused on the front-end only; you don't need to connect to an API or implement any kind of back-end.

## Structure

For this activity, work on your own.

## User stories

*As a user, I should be able to…*

- See a list of recipes
- For each recipe, see a name, a brief description, and a list of ingredients
- 'Like' a given recipe
- See which recipes I have previously liked
- Filter the page to only show liked recipes

## Extensions

- A recipe can be 'disliked', hiding it from view
- Recipes can be liked more than once, with more-liked recipes listed higher on the page
- Recipes can be filtered by ingredient

## Guidance

- This is an **independent** task, but that doesn’t mean you can’t ask for help; it just means that each person is building their own unique app.
- Hardcode your recipe data; don't spend too much time on it though, as it's not the focus.
- Start simple, and get more complicated: at first a list of `<h1>` tags, then a list of recipe names, then a list of recipe cards, and so on.
- Think carefully about what should be turned into a component.
